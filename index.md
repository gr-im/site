_Salutations_, you've landed on my personal webpage. I'm known as **Grim** in
the online realm, but my real name is `Pierre`. I work as a **software
engineer** at [The Funkyworkers](https://github.com/funkywork), where my primary
tool is the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) language. This site serves as a
structured platform for me to articulate and expound upon responses I've shared
across various channels, as well as to document experimental endeavours. The
material featured on this website is licensed under [CC BY-SA
4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), unless otherwise
specified. I mainly use **Mastodon**
([`grm@functional.cafe`](https://functional.cafe/@grm)) as a public
communication channel.
